## Free software

1. The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
2. The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
3. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
4. The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

## Why Choose a License
It is important to choose a license because without a license, software will
be considered all rights reserved which may not be how the developers wanted
it to be.  A license also allows for developers to define exactly how people
may use the software, and allows all people interested in the software to be
sure whether they can edit or distribute it.  Projects that have licenses
displaying that the project is open will most likely have better luck gaining
developers and hackers than a project without a license.

## Why Not use License-less Code
It is a bad idea to use code without a license because the code is all rights
reserved until it is given a license.  This means that using the code is
copyright infringement and could get someone in trouble if they did not ask
the owner for consent before hand.  By using code with a license, there is
no confusion whether or not the code can be used or modified.

## Why Gopher Failed
I agree somewhat with the claims that the author made.  I believe that it is
much more beneficial to open up software early versus late and that it is
important to get as many minds thinking about the development of the software
as possible instead of closing the project off from potential outside
developers.  While it is hard for me to judge exactly how great of an impact
this had on the Gopher project, I believe that a project that has more minds
thinking about it early on has a greater chance for success.

## Why .NET Core uses the MIT license
Microsoft probably chose to use the MIT license because it is an open license
that allows people to do what they want without holding Microsoft accountable
for issues that occur due to using the software.  Since the .NET core is just
a bunch of compiler and library components, being open allows anyone interested
to tinker with it and encourages people to use the components to make their own
software (which may not run on Windows but most of the time probably does).  It
also helps Microsoft to improve their own software running on the .NET core
since many people are developing the .NET core at once.  Since it is just the
core, leaving the license as open as possible benefits Microsoft by building
a community around their software.

## An example project...
#### An operating system for toasters
A good license for an operating system for toasters would be the Apache
License 2.0.  The reason why this would be a good license is because it allows
for modification and changes, but also allows for patent claims by contributers
to the code.  This would encourage different types of toaster companies
interested in creating the next gen toaster to contribute to the OS since
they can still claim patents for what they come up with, but gain the benefits
of an open source project (similar to Android).

## The Right License for Different people
* For individual developers I would choose the LGPL license because it allows
for freedom to do what you want, but also allows for applications built off
of the code to be closed source.  This would allow the developer to start a
project open source but once they feel ready to make a company out of it, close
the software and sell the application (or something).
* For companies I believe that the Apache license is the best fit because the
Apache license allows patent claims which are often times important to companies
and allows the companies to gain something proprietary from an otherwise open
software project.  It also convinces customer and even competing companies to
contribute to the project.
* For the greater good, the GPL license is probably the best since it keeps the
software open down the line and doesn't allow people to change the license on
their redistributions or applications that use the software.
