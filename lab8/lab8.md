##Status Report

The group has gotten together and has figured out the scope and type of
additions that we wish to make to the project.  We have divided up the work
for the initial projects, and all have cloned the forked repository and have
begun familiarizing ourselves with the code.  By this weekend we hope to begin
coding our new features and working with each other when we have problems!
